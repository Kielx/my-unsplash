My-Unsplash is a modern image gallery where anyone can upload photos. The app displays them in a modern masonry layout. The app is built using Next.js with a backend hosted at firebase storage. The state is stored in the redux toolkit store. With dark mode, TailwindCSS, and responsive layout.

## Overview

The project was a challenge from [devchallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/rYyhwJAxMfES5jNQ9YsP).
The project incorporates the Image Uploader component from [Image-Uploader](https://github.com/Kielx/image-uploader)

### The challenge

Create my Unsplash app. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Create your API. Donâ€™t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:

- I can see a list of photos in the masonry layout that I have added
- I can add a new photo to the list - the new photo should be on top of the list
- I can search for photos by label
- When I hover a photo, I can see a label and a delete button
- I can delete images


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com//)

### What I learned
